# EngineeringTeam Crew

Welcome to the EngineeringTeam Crew project! This repository demonstrates a multi-agent AI workflow for building, testing, and running a simple loan management system for a personal banking platform, using [crewAI](https://crewai.com).

## Project Overview

This project features a crew of specialized AI agents that collaborate to:
- Design a Python module for loan management
- Implement the backend logic
- Write unit tests
- Build a simple Gradio UI for demonstration

The system allows users to apply for loans, approve them, make repayments, and view loan status, amortization schedules, and payment summaries.

## Installation
